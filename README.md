This text based game is my very first project using python. The game is pretty straight forward.

You start in the main area and from there you will need to navigate 
through each room and collect items until you have all six.

Once you have collected all six items you need to navigate to the room
with the 'Villain' inside and from there you will be prompted to decide what to do from there.

I hope you enjoy the game, it took me a few days to complete it as it was my first project.
