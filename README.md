#  This text based game is my very first project using python. The game pretty straight forward.

#  You start in the main area and from there you will need to navigate 
#  through each room and collect the items until you have all six items.

#  Once you have collected all six items you need to navigate to the room
#  with the Villain inside and you will be prompted to decide what to do from there.

#  I hope you enjoy the game, it took me a few days to complete it as it was my first project.
#  Any foodback on how I can improve would be greatly appreciated.
